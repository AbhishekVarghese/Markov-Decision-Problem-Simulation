# Markov-Decision-Problem-Simulation

This is a simulation of the standard textbook MDP environment(Robot in a maze) made using SimpleGUI and python.

## Environment is defined as follows :

Goal - Get to the green square without touching the red square within certain number of moves.
Actions - Up, Down, Left or Right 

Randomness : When an agent takes an action it goes in the correct direction with probability 0.8, or with a probability of 0.1 it can steer either to the left or to the right.

The V value and the best action on each square is available.


There are 2 files.
MDP.py is the simulation
MDP_environment is to understand the basic environment without the randomness.
